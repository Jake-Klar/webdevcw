NASA's rovers, including Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, have landed on Mars to explore the planet's surface and gather data since 2004. The successful landing of rovers on Mars has provided crucial insights into the planet's history, climate, and potential for life. Curiosity's landing in 2012 and Perseverance's landing in 2021, in particular, marked significant advancements in the exploration of Mars. These missions have been instrumental in assessing the possibility of past microbial life on Mars and preparing for future human missions to the planet.

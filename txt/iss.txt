The first module of the International Space Station (ISS), Zarya, was launched on November 20, 1998. The ISS represents one of the most ambitious and collaborative projects in the history of human space activities, involving space agencies from the United States (NASA), Russia (Roscosmos), Europe (ESA), Japan (JAXA), and Canada (CSA). The ISS serves as a research laboratory, promoting international cooperation in space exploration, and provides valuable data on the effects of long-term space travel on the human body. It is also a critical platform for scientific experiments that benefit life on Earth.
